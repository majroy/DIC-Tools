# DIC Tools
This set of scripts and functions meant to provide utilities for post processing of digital image correlation (DIC) datasets. The following describes the various scripts available - with the intention that more demonstrations will be built out in the near future. The intention is to store DIC datasets with a scientific database provider, and host the analysis scripts here.

All files are presume that incoming files are in the same local directory - when cloning, move all scripts to where these files are hosted.

## VIC_curvebuilder
Processes tabulates mechanical test frame data and 2D DIC data as processed by VIC-2D to generate flow stress curves.
